# Kaden-Lee-s-Playable-Portfolio
The ultimate repository storing any and all significant coding projects created in part by me, Kaden Lee

If you want to play the games, all you have to do is download the desired .zip folder, extract, and run the .exe file! Hope you find what I make interesting!

# The catalog:
Majikal Undead - 2D top-down shooter where the player must collect 3 spellbooks, kill zombies, and defeat the boss! There are three unique levels; complete one to start the next!
PacMan - A Unity recreation of Pac-Man. Not perfect, but interesting nonetheless.
